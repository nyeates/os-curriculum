  * On the first preface of this book, Richard Stallman provides some insight as to how his interest in open source culture began. It all started with a printer that kept jamming. He found out there was a software issue with the printer that could easily be solved with his software knowledge. Upon calling the printer's cmopany and requesting the source code for his printer, he was immediately dismissed and told such a thing would not happen. Frustrated, his path towards creating / promoting the open source culture we have today began.
